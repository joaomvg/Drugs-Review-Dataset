# Drugs-Review-Dataset

Analysis of the UCI Drugs reviews dataset. The dataset can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00462/.
This analysis was part of my Udacity Capstone project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

Brief description of the files:
* drugs-dataset.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing all the analysis from SKlearn models to Pytorch feedfoward NN 1-layer, 2-layer and LSTM models. It also includes code for
training in remote AWS instance.
* drugs-review-AWS.ipynb: contains training of SKLearn models in AWS remote instance
* lstm_training: Sagemaker python training scripts for LSTM model
* ffn_training: Sagemaker python training scripts
